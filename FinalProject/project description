The dataset consists of 60000 32 Ã— 32 color (RBG) images in 10 classes, with 6000 images per class. 
The 10 classes are: airplane, automobile, bird, cat, deer, dog, frog, horse, ship and truck. 
There are 50000 training images and 10000 test images. 
The main purpose of this final project is to develop a machine learning algorithm that can automatically recognize test images. 
The machine learning algorithm is trained by the large amount of training images and we explore different ways to optimize the algorithm.

The dataset is divided into five training batches and one test batch, each with 10000 images. 
The test batch contains exactly 1000 randomly-selected images from each class. 
The training batches contain the remaining images in random order, but some training batches may contain more images from one class than another. 
Between them, the training batches contain exactly 5000 images from each class.
